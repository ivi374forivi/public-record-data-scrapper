# Credibility Signals Framework
## Building Trust with Non-Technical Executives

**Purpose:** Identify and emphasize moments throughout the portfolio video that establish credibility, competence, and trustworthiness without relying on technical jargon.

---

## Overview: Why Credibility Matters

Executives evaluating candidates make decisions based on:
1. **Risk Mitigation** - Can this person be trusted with important work?
2. **Value Creation** - Will this person generate ROI?
3. **Communication** - Can this person work with non-technical stakeholders?
4. **Strategic Thinking** - Does this person understand business, not just code?
5. **Execution** - Can this person ship results, not just talk about them?

This framework identifies specific moments in the video where these qualities are reinforced.

## Red Flags to Avoid

### What NOT to Do:

#### 1. Excessive Jargon
- **Problem:** "We used GraphQL with Apollo Client and Redis caching..."
- **Fix:** "We built a system that updates in real-time..."
- **Why:** Excludes non-technical viewers, signals poor communication

#### 2. Hedging Language
- **Problem:** "I tried to...", "I think maybe...", "Hopefully this..."
- **Fix:** "I built...", "This solves...", "The result is..."
- **Why:** Reduces confidence, suggests uncertainty

#### 3. Feature Lists
- **Problem:** "It has 50 agents, ML scoring, exports, filters..."
- **Fix:** "It identifies which prospects to pursue and why."
- **Why:** Features without context don't demonstrate value

#### 4. Apologetic Tone
- **Problem:** "This probably isn't perfect but..."
- **Fix:** State what works, acknowledge room for growth naturally
- **Why:** Self-sabotage undermines credibility

#### 5. Overexplaining
- **Problem:** Three sentences explaining one concept
- **Fix:** One clear sentence, then move on
- **Why:** Suggests lack of clarity or communication skill

## Measuring Credibility Impact

### Post-Production Assessment:

Show video to test audience (ideally 2-3 non-technical professionals) and ask:

1. **Trust:** "Would you trust this person with an important project?" (Yes/No/Maybe)
2. **Value:** "Do you understand what value this person would bring?" (Yes/No/Maybe)
3. **Communication:** "Did you understand the core message?" (Yes/No/Maybe)
4. **Distinction:** "What makes this person different from other candidates?" (Open)
5. **Action:** "Would you want to interview this person?" (Yes/No/Maybe)

**Target:** 80%+ "Yes" on questions 1-3, clear differentiation on question 4, 100% "Yes" on question 5.

---

## Final Reminder

Credibility isn't built through claims—it's demonstrated through:
- **Specificity** (not vague generalities)
- **Results** (not just activities)
- **Clarity** (not complexity)
- **Confidence** (not arrogance)
- **Completeness** (not just highlights)

Every moment in the video should either build credibility or advance the narrative. If a section does neither, cut it.

**Remember:** Trust is the foundation of hiring decisions. Technical skills can be verified through tests; judgment, communication, and strategic thinking must be evident in how you present yourself.
