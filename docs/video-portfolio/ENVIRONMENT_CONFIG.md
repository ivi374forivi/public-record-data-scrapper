## Advanced: Dynamic Content Generation

If using automated video generation tools, you can use these variables programmatically:

```javascript
// Example: Load config and generate personalized script
const config = require('./.env.portfolio');

const hook = `Every day, thousands of businesses in ${config.BUSINESS_DOMAIN} 
face a critical problem: ${config.KEY_PROBLEM}`;

const cta = `If you're looking for ${config.CANDIDATE_ROLE_TARGET}, 
let's ${config.CTA_OUTCOME}. Visit ${config.CTA_URL}`;
```

---

## Updating Configuration

### When to Update:
- **Targeting different role:** Change `CANDIDATE_ROLE_TARGET`, `TARGET_AUDIENCE`, `NARRATIVE_EMPHASIS`
- **Different project:** Change `PROJECT_NAME`, `KEY_PROBLEM`, `KEY_INNOVATION`
- **Brand refresh:** Update `BRAND_COLOR_*` and `BRAND_FONT_*`
- **New CTA:** Update `CTA_URL`, `CTA_OUTCOME`

### Version Control:
- Keep `.env.portfolio.template` in repository (with placeholders)
- Add `.env.portfolio` to `.gitignore` (personal information)
- Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md` if updating template structure

---

**Remember:** These variables are the foundation of your video. Take time to set them thoughtfully—they'll save hours during production and ensure consistency throughout.
