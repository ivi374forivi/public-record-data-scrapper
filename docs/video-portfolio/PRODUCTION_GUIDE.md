## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Audio Problems
**Issue:** Background noise/hiss  
**Solution:** Apply noise reduction in post (Audacity: Effect → Noise Reduction)

**Issue:** Inconsistent volume  
**Solution:** Normalize all sections to -3dB, apply gentle compression

**Issue:** Mouth clicks/pops  
**Solution:** Drink water, edit out manually, apply de-clicker plugin

#### Visual Problems
**Issue:** Text too small on mobile  
**Solution:** Minimum 24pt font size, test on actual phone screen

**Issue:** Colors look different on different screens  
**Solution:** Export with sRGB color space, test on multiple devices

**Issue:** Video too large (file size)  
**Solution:** Lower bitrate slightly (aim for <100MB per minute)

#### Timing Problems
**Issue:** Video too long (>5 minutes)  
**Solution:** Remove technical sophistication section, trim examples

**Issue:** Feels rushed  
**Solution:** Add 0.5-1 second pauses between major sections

**Issue:** Boring pacing  
**Solution:** Vary visual tempo—faster during lists, slower during key concepts
