## How to Use This Glossary

### Format:
**Technical Term** → **Business Translation** → **Example Usage** → **Why It Works**

### Rules:
1. **Never use the technical term alone** without context
2. **Lead with the benefit**, then explain the mechanism if needed
3. **Use metaphors** that executives already understand
4. **Quantify impact** whenever possible

## Translation Checklist

Before using any technical term in your video, ask:

- [ ] Would my parents / non-technical friend understand this?
- [ ] Have I explained the "why" (value) before the "what" (feature)?
- [ ] Is there a simpler word or metaphor I could use?
- [ ] Does this term create confusion or require explanation?
- [ ] Am I accidentally showing off knowledge instead of communicating?

If you answered "no" to question 1 or "yes" to questions 4-5, rewrite using this glossary.
