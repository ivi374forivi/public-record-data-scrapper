## Customization Tips

### Adjust for Your Brand:
1. Replace "cyan and amber" with your brand colors
2. Add your logo watermark to generated assets (subtle, corner placement)
3. Ensure all visuals align with your personal brand aesthetic

### Adapt for Video Length:
- **Shorter (2-3 min):** Use 3-4 key prompts, focus on strongest metaphors
- **Longer (5-7 min):** Include full set, layer B-roll throughout
- **Social (30-60 sec):** Use 1-2 striking visuals on loop with text overlay

### Testing:
- Generate 2-3 variations of each prompt
- Select the clearest, most professional result
- Test on different screens (phone, laptop, projector)
- Ensure visuals support rather than distract from narration
